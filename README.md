This project is an introduction to cyber security in the field of the WWW.

# Introduction
When you develop your first websites, you will have absolutely no clue regarding the risks
they will be exposed to in the World Wide Web.
This little project is here to teach you the basics: you will learn about these risks
and vulnerabilities while auditing a simple website. This website shows breaches, some
of which still show on well established websites you visit on a daily basis.
Here is a major introduction to general vulnerabilities you will face on the World
Wide Web.

# Objectives
This project aims to make you discover cyber security in the field of the WWW.
You will discover OWASP, which simply is the largest cyber security project to this
day.
You will also find out what many frameworks do for you, automatically and transparently.
